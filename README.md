# Key findings and recommendations
•	There’s a decline in the number of users. Recommendations include conducting customer survey, improving device functionalities, and analysing marketing strategy.

•	Being lightly active is the highest activity intensity level meaning that people are mostly less engaged in intense activities. Send prompts to people to be more active. 

•	Prompts should be targeted for activity down times: 11:00 am, 15:00 pm and 20:00 pm.
